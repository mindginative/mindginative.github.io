 Thanks for the event! I really enjoyed the Docker crash course, it was certainly an eye-opener for me :)
HUGE thanks. Get me started with docker:P
 Attendees feedback, how cool is that ?! it was held on 21 of March 2016
I thought it was a good meetup, the room wasnâ€™t really that packed but it was a good crowd. Although, was a bit lost and had to find my way through the conference room but location-wise ?</description>
