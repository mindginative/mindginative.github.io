Hi there, My name is **Richard** I'm a full-stack web developer from New Zealand.

My main tools of the trade is JavaScript however I'm a dabbler so sometimes I mess around with technologies like: Docker, Terraform, AWS Web Services, Linux configuration, CI, Bash scripting, Go, Rust, mobile development, DNS, contracting - I've dabbled enough to understand a full stack system.

My curiosity in various areas of tech stack on/off my day job means I can to talk to and communicate effectively with people in other areas.

> It is this communication skill which makes me a productive team member, not raw coding ability. <br />~ Josh Marinacci
