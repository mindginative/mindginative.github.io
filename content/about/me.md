Hi it's **Richard** here, a full-stack web developer from New Zealand. I build stuff mainly on JavaScript and Node.js

I'm also dabbler so sometimes I mess around with technologies like: Docker, Terraform, AWS Web Services, Linux configuration, CI, Bash scripting, Go, Rust, mobile development, networking, contracting - I've dabbled enough to understand a full stack system.

My curiosity in various areas of tech stack on/off my day job means I can to talk to and communicate effectively with people in other areas.
