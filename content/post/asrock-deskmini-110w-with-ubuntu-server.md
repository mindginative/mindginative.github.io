About 8 months ago when I saw the Intel NUC at local computer store, I thought maybe I could get one for my expirements/projects. One that I could just leave running (headless) on one corner and either do of the following:

* Remote SSH from a local coffee shop: download stuff, etc
* Remote development while travelling overseas where internet speed isn't great

I did a bit of research about Intel NUC, just wanted to make sure that it will be worthy for the price that I'd be paying for. However as I dig more info about it - blogs, reviews and forums - the following tipped off the scale for NUC:

* Price
* Hardware Upgrades

## Hardware

The Toshiba and Western Digital SATA disks are old stuff I pulled out from an old laptop.

## Issues

It wouldn't be an exciting stuff if there are no issues, don't you think ?

#### BIOS & Kaby Lake

Once you get the build done and pushed the start button - *IT WON'T BOOT THE F\*\*K BOOT UP!* why?! - Kaby Lake processor needs UEFI/BIOS version 7.0 or greater. To fix this issue you either need to do the following:

  - Ask the retailers/tech guys to flash the BIOS for you - before handling over your money, this is what I did.
  - Get a spare Skylake processor, boot it up on Windows and flash the BIOS with your barehand.

## Future Plan

Obviously we want the best, fastest and the latest - so my wishlist for this box are:

  - [Noctua NH-L9i](http://noctua.at/en/nh-l9i)
  - [Intel Skylake Core i7 6700K 4.0Ghz 8MB LGA 1151](https://ark.intel.com/products/88195/Intel-Core-i7-6700K-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_20-GHz)
  - [Vengeance® Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4 SODIMM ](http://www.corsair.com/en-gb/vengeance-series-32gb-2x16gb-ddr4-sodimm-3000mhz-cl16-memory-kit-cmsx32gx4m2a3000c16)

## Conclusion

Overall I'm happy with this box, gets the job done. It's been just few weeks since I built this and its current uptime is 11 days.
The OS is Ubuntu Server 16.04.2 LTS + Docker version 17.03.1-ce with 3 running Docker containers for my fullstack development.
Head over at the references below should you need more details.

I will have another blog for the OS and development experience so stay tuned.
