Attendees feedback, how cool is that ?! it was held on 21 of March 2016

I thought it was a good meetup, the room wasn’t really that packed but it was a good crowd.
Although, was a bit lost and had to find my way through the conference room but location-wise ? really good.

I wasn’t expecting to be doing a lot of hands on and didn’t bring my laptop, just wanted to sit down , watch & listen — ha! — wrong.
I was about to shoot off early but managed to sit down with someone and did a bit of agile-ish Docker training — kind of pair programming if you like, hurray!

The organisers were friendly and helpful
