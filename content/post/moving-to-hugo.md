I was initially planning to use plain Github Pages for my blogging but I've read some good reviews with Hugo.
I'll give it a try and see how it goes.

I have written a few blog posts over at Medium but I don't want to spam my Twitter followers with random information that don't matter to them.
I might sync a few bits from time to time.
