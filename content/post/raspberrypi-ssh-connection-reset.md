I was trying to copy files to my Raspbian-based Raspberry Pi but I kept getting this error:

> ssh: connect to host 192.168.178.79 port 22: Connection refused

## Tell-tale Sign

after few attempts the ssh status showed up an interesting set of logs:

$> sudo service ssh status
```

## Fix

googling brought me to this article [1], there are 2 suggested CLI commands but the command below fixed my issue:

`$> sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* && sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server`

It will generate a new set of ssh certs, like so:
