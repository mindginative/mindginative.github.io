In response to [Victor Savkin's](https://blog.nrwl.io/@vsavkin) blog about "[Write it Down](https://blog.nrwl.io/write-it-down-55086ca4f2ee)" 2 days ago.

> Retrospectives are important. That’s why software development teams get together once a week to see what works and what can be improved. We know small adjustments add up. So why don’t we apply the same approach in our day-to-day lives?

I decided to give it a try, and set some goal after-work hours. The "Lessons Learned" had a surprising result.

## My Goal
- Organize Trello for work
- Get a life (kids, wife, family)

## Today's Target
- Declutter Trello
- Read AWS whitepaper, conference videos
- Setup Docker container for webapp I'm working on

## Wins
- Managed to re-organized all my Trello boards, though still in-progress but it's a lot better than before
- I spent time with my kids + wife: with Gadgets, TV turned off

## Lessons Learned
- I was so disorganized
- I was careless about the time I spent on useless stuff eg. reading news, watching useless youtube recommendation videos
- I am not really accomplishing anything on my personal projects, goals
- there were too many interruptions but this is due to my disorganised routine

it's my second day, and I'd like to continue doing this - the system needs some tweaking for my lifestyle however the daily restrospective and writing it down made a lot of sense for me.

I'm looking to buy the notebook that Victor used in his journal but don't know if it is available in New Zealand. For the meantime I'm sketching it manually on a A5 Art Notebook - works well though!

Have a great weekend!
