      <description>About 8 months ago when I saw the Intel NUC at local computer store, I thought maybe I could get one for my expirements/projects. One that I could just leave running (headless) on one corner and either do of the following:
 Remote SSH from a local coffee shop: download stuff, etc Remote development while travelling overseas where internet speed isn&amp;rsquo;t great  I did a bit of research about Intel NUC, just wanted to make sure that it will be worthy for the price that I&amp;rsquo;d be paying for.</description>
