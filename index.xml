      <title>12 Hours Hackathon with React JavaScript Library</title>

      <description>In the last few months I received cold calls and emails from various recruiters - locals and outside NZ.
One thing I kept hearing as one of the requirements: React
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a production experience with React however IMHO if a developer has done a bit of JS development I don&amp;rsquo;t think onboarding is rocket science plus if you think that your/their team is bad-ass then I&amp;rsquo;d pressume onboarding gets even a lot easier - fancy build, pair programming ?</description>

      <title>That! SSH permission denied on eCryptfs-enabled file system</title>

      <description>On the day my DeskMini Headless server was born - it was christened with ecryptfs and I did that on purpose - paranoid!
Gearing up for a password-less configuration was supposedly and easy task later then I realised that my first SSH session won&amp;rsquo;t work. This is for obvious reason: the home folder ~/ isn&amp;rsquo;t readable - yet - not until you manually mount the folder. By default SSH will look for authorized_keys file at the user&amp;rsquo;s home folder henced SSH can&amp;rsquo;t read it - you&amp;rsquo;ll get Permission denied (publickey).</description>

      <description>Last week I had the privileged to travel and visit Boston, USA. It&amp;rsquo;s old but a great &amp;amp; lovely city. Food are bit cheaper than NZ, oops!
I was looking for great coffee but sad to say I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a good one, sorry, NZ&amp;rsquo;s coffee still the best - even the petrol station near at my place was way better.
On the bright side, in Boston, food was epic! here are a few food places I went to:</description>

      <description>Alright! this was my 2nd year in a row for this web security conference here in Auckland, New Zealand. This is the type conference that would never fails to impress myself: the work and research they&amp;rsquo;ve (personal or business related) is great.
They had a good list of local and international speakers, which I think - particularly for inviting international speakers - is good the fact that the audience (like me) will get a different insights outside of the local security threats/tools or knowledge in general.</description>

      <title>First Taste of Win10 BitLocker</title>

      <guid>http://www.mindginative.com/post/first-taste-of-win10-bitlocker/</guid>
      <description>I bought the idea of encrypting my OS drive, since I&amp;rsquo;m on Windows 10 I opted the closed source utility called BitLocker. Prior to trusting my gut - I had initially configured my Ubuntu-based headless server with eCryptfs.
If you peek at eCryptfs about page, one of the authors became a member of BitLocker team at Microsoft - so I guess that&amp;rsquo;s why I pushed the &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; button.

      <description>About 8 months ago when I saw the Intel NUC at local computer store, I thought maybe I could get one for my expirements/projects. One that I could just leave running (headless) on one corner and either do of the following:
 Remote SSH from a local coffee shop: download stuff, etc Remote development while travelling overseas where internet speed isn&amp;rsquo;t great  I did a bit of research about Intel NUC, just wanted to make sure that it will be worthy for the price that I&amp;rsquo;d be paying for.</description>

      <title>Domain Registrar migration from GoDaddy to AWS Route53: Short Story</title>

      <description>After a fantastic 9+ years with GoDaddy, I moved on - yep, AWS Route53 is the domain registrar for mindginative.com. Nope not because of a horrible things that just happened nor bad customer experience.
A million reasons:
 They&amp;rsquo;re just my domain provider, I only remember them when it&amp;rsquo;s time to renew my domain - the rest were fully managed by AWS Route53 eg. DNS, Subdomains, Servers, etc.
 Target Audience It aims at people who are already using AWS Route53 as their DNS provider, for newcomers - I guess you&amp;rsquo;ll have to touch base with DNS first, see Migrating DNS Service for an existing Domain to Amazon Route53</description>

      <title>Setting up Bitbucket&#39;s Pipelines for frontend deployment on AWS S3</title>

      <description>Bitbucket is my main git repo for all my personal (PoC) projects, portfolio and all of my contracting projects - hands down on private repo.
While I&amp;rsquo;ve tried Codeship, CircleCI, Jenkins for production use, however, all of these CI server needs some little education about private and public certificates for setting up roles/permission/access before any of them can pull out your source code and push it to eg: Amazon S3 &amp;mdash; Pipelines + AWS S3 was far bit easier.</description>

 I have been doing some form of frontend development since the early 90s.
 from the blog&amp;rsquo;s first sentence I quickly recalled the first website I designed 14yrs ago, worked started in late 2002 but it was launched in 2003. I remember dabbling with Macromedia&amp;rsquo;s Fireworks and Dreamweaver.</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s The Fuss? Node Version Manager (nvm) gets installed, we&amp;rsquo;ll then use it to install whatever is the current NodeJS LTS - primarily behind the scenes, it will spear you from crap of load of these commands:</description>

      <description>Short-lived scripts that sucked your resources for 1mins or at most 5mins - is probably fine. However, if it is recurring jobs in Cron and involves several tasks and at least an hour of processing - that&amp;rsquo;d be a different story.
I was working on a simple NodeJS-based cron script with only 3 requirements:
 extract transform load  Each one of these however would involve crunching through a million rows of data.</description>

      <description>Wait, what ? Moving to Windows10 (6 months ago as of this writing) as my main OS is a bit hard, just a little bit. I use commandline ALL THE TIME and I can&amp;rsquo;t live without the developer&amp;rsquo;s Swiss army knife on my side - tiny tools that make our life easier: grep, sed, ps, tree, ssh, find &amp;hellip;
&amp;ldquo;Bash On Windows&amp;rdquo; was a good strategy from Microsoft - I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother about switching to Windows and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think twice, I was more worried about which machine to buy.</description>

      <description>Yesterday 10th of Feb 2017, I managed to update my PC with the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 15031. The list contains a massive set of features as well as fixes, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t mind the upgrade. It took at least 20mins to get it done. Once done, my NodeJS environment started complaining, btw I am using Node Version Manager.
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I got when switching NodeJS versions:</description>

      <description>I was working on transcoding videos into different formats, resolutions so it could be played on various desktops, tablets and mobile devices. My main working machine is Dell XPS13 on Windows 10 with Ubuntu Bash enabled, some of my needed libraries is missing and needs recompilation of FFmpeg the one that came from Ubuntu 14.04 repo.
I think I&amp;rsquo;ve literraly spent hours or probably days buildin/re-building libraries just to get the videos transcoded into my desired format.</description>

      <description>Since moving to Hugo few months ago my installation history with Go was quick and dirty, I just want to get something up running to get started with Hugo. 48 hours ago I was playing with Go, I thought of building a simple cli utility where CI server can hook in and start building something - of course it has be built on top of Go, enough to get my around its dev-ecosystem.</description>

I have written a few blog posts over at Medium but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spam my Twitter followers with random information that don&amp;rsquo;t matter to them. I might sync a few bits from time to time.</description>

      <description>Looking at few stats: 6.9k Github stars and 700k npm downloads in the last month (at the time of this writing) it‚Äôs no wonder that you can always find plugins, tools or utilities that will link up Browsersync with your favourite frontend or server side framework to ease up your browser testing. It is packed with good features as mentioned in Addy Osmani‚Äôs 2013 blog but its ghostMode and Proxy options are spot on in my opinion.</description>

      <description>Hi there, My name is Richard I&amp;rsquo;m a full-stack web developer from New Zealand.
My main tools of the trade is JavaScript however I&amp;rsquo;m a dabbler so sometimes I mess around with technologies like: Docker, Terraform, AWS Web Services, Linux configuration, CI, Bash scripting, Go, Rust, mobile development, DNS, contracting - I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled enough to understand a full stack system.
My curiosity in various areas of tech stack on/off my day job means I can to talk to and communicate effectively with people in other areas.</description>
