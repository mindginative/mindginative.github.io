<p>In the last few months I received cold calls and emails from various recruiters - locals and outside NZ.
One thing I kept hearing as one of the requirements: React
I don&rsquo;t have a production experience with React however IMHO if a developer has done a bit of JS development I don&rsquo;t think onboarding is rocket science plus if you think that your/their team is bad-ass then I&rsquo;d pressume onboarding gets even a lot easier - fancy build, pair programming ?</p>

<p>On the day my DeskMini Headless server was born - it was christened with ecryptfs and I did that on purpose - paranoid!
Gearing up for a password-less configuration was supposedly and easy task later then I realised that my first SSH session won&rsquo;t work. This is for obvious reason: the home folder ~/ isn&rsquo;t readable - yet - not until you manually mount the folder. By default SSH will look for authorized_keys file at the user&rsquo;s home folder henced SSH can&rsquo;t read it - you&rsquo;ll get Permission denied (publickey).</p>

<p>Last week I had the privileged to travel and visit Boston, USA. It&rsquo;s old but a great &amp; lovely city. Food are bit cheaper than NZ, oops!
I was looking for great coffee but sad to say I didn&rsquo;t find a good one, sorry, NZ&rsquo;s coffee still the best - even the petrol station near at my place was way better.
On the bright side, in Boston, food was epic! here are a few food places I went to:</p>

<p>Alright! this was my 2nd year in a row for this web security conference here in Auckland, New Zealand. This is the type conference that would never fails to impress myself: the work and research they&rsquo;ve (personal or business related) is great.
They had a good list of local and international speakers, which I think - particularly for inviting international speakers - is good the fact that the audience (like me) will get a different insights outside of the local security threats/tools or knowledge in general.</p>

<p>I bought the idea of encrypting my OS drive, since I&rsquo;m on Windows 10 I opted the closed source utility called BitLocker. Prior to trusting my gut - I had initially configured my Ubuntu-based headless server with eCryptfs.
If you peek at eCryptfs about page, one of the authors became a member of BitLocker team at Microsoft - so I guess that&rsquo;s why I pushed the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; button.

<p>About 8 months ago when I saw the Intel NUC at local computer store, I thought maybe I could get one for my expirements/projects. One that I could just leave running (headless) on one corner and either do of the following:
 Remote SSH from a local coffee shop: download stuff, etc Remote development while travelling overseas where internet speed isn&rsquo;t great  I did a bit of research about Intel NUC, just wanted to make sure that it will be worthy for the price that I&rsquo;d be paying for.</p>

<p>After a fantastic 9+ years with GoDaddy, I moved on - yep, AWS Route53 is the domain registrar for mindginative.com. Nope not because of a horrible things that just happened nor bad customer experience.
A million reasons:
 They&rsquo;re just my domain provider, I only remember them when it&rsquo;s time to renew my domain - the rest were fully managed by AWS Route53 eg. DNS, Subdomains, Servers, etc.
 Target Audience It aims at people who are already using AWS Route53 as their DNS provider, for newcomers - I guess you&rsquo;ll have to touch base with DNS first, see Migrating DNS Service for an existing Domain to Amazon Route53</p>

<p>I was trying to copy files to my Raspbian-based Raspberry Pi but I kept getting this error:
 ssh: connect to host 192.168.178.79 port 22: Connection refused
 Tell-tale Sign after few attempts the ssh status showed up an interesting set of logs:

<p>Bitbucket is my main git repo for all my personal (PoC) projects, portfolio and all of my contracting projects - hands down on private repo.
While I&rsquo;ve tried Codeship, CircleCI, Jenkins for production use, however, all of these CI server needs some little education about private and public certificates for setting up roles/permission/access before any of them can pull out your source code and push it to eg: Amazon S3 &mdash; Pipelines + AWS S3 was far bit easier.</p>

<p>Weekend Saturday morning, my JavaScript Weekly subscription #329 had a catchy email subject title Opinionated Comparison of React, Angular2, and Aurelia, read full article here
 I have been doing some form of frontend development since the early 90s.
 from the blog&rsquo;s first sentence I quickly recalled the first website I designed 14yrs ago, worked started in late 2002 but it was launched in 2003. I remember dabbling with Macromedia&rsquo;s Fireworks and Dreamweaver.</p>
