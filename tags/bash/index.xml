      <description>I was working on transcoding videos into different formats, resolutions so it could be played on various desktops, tablets and mobile devices. My main working machine is Dell XPS13 on Windows 10 with Ubuntu Bash enabled, some of my needed libraries is missing and needs recompilation of FFmpeg the one that came from Ubuntu 14.04 repo.
I think I&amp;rsquo;ve literraly spent hours or probably days buildin/re-building libraries just to get the videos transcoded into my desired format.</description>

      <description>Since moving to Hugo few months ago my installation history with Go was quick and dirty, I just want to get something up running to get started with Hugo. 48 hours ago I was playing with Go, I thought of building a simple cli utility where CI server can hook in and start building something - of course it has be built on top of Go, enough to get my around its dev-ecosystem.</description>
