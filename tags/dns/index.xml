      <description>After a fantastic 9+ years with GoDaddy, I moved on - yep, AWS Route53 is the domain registrar for mindginative.com. Nope not because of a horrible things that just happened nor bad customer experience.
A million reasons:
 They&amp;rsquo;re just my domain provider, I only remember them when it&amp;rsquo;s time to renew my domain - the rest were fully managed by AWS Route53 eg. DNS, Subdomains, Servers, etc.
 Target Audience It aims at people who are already using AWS Route53 as their DNS provider, for newcomers - I guess you&amp;rsquo;ll have to touch base with DNS first, see Migrating DNS Service for an existing Domain to Amazon Route53</description>
