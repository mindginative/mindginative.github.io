      <description>One thing I kept hearing as part of the requirements: React
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a production experience with React, however, IMHO if a developer has done a bit of JS development in the past I don&amp;rsquo;t think onboarding is rocket science.
 At the end of the day, it&amp;rsquo;s just JavaScript!
 I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on a couple of personal projects and thought of using React at some stage but instead I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to do hackathon on a simple React project and see where it would take me, I didn&amp;rsquo;t set a deadline.</description>
