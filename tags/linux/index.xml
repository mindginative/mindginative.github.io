      <description>Apology for the last word &amp;ldquo;Win10&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s bit misleading but my main development machine is Dell XPS 13 on Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview. There&amp;rsquo;s should be a follow up to this blog hopefully on my headless Ubuntu Server.
BTW, it&amp;rsquo;s a PITA to get this thing working on my Win10 machine - too many wrangling with Windows GUI DNS settings, Docker vEthernet adapter then a mixed of CLI scripts, some won&amp;rsquo;t work on plain CLI commands later then I discovered that wrapping it inside docker-compose.</description>

      <description>About 8 months ago when I saw the Intel NUC at local computer store, I thought maybe I could get one for my expirements/projects. One that I could just leave running (headless) on one corner and either do of the following:
 Remote SSH from a local coffee shop: download stuff, etc Remote development while travelling overseas where internet speed isn&amp;rsquo;t great  I did a bit of research about Intel NUC, just wanted to make sure that it will be worthy for the price that I&amp;rsquo;d be paying for.</description>

      <description>Wait, what ? Moving to Windows10 (6 months ago as of this writing) as my main OS is a bit hard, just a little bit. I use commandline ALL THE TIME and I can&amp;rsquo;t live without the developer&amp;rsquo;s Swiss army knife on my side - tiny tools that make our life easier: grep, sed, ps, tree, ssh, find &amp;hellip;
&amp;ldquo;Bash On Windows&amp;rdquo; was a good strategy from Microsoft - I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother about switching to Windows and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think twice, I was more worried about which machine to buy.</description>
