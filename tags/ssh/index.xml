      <description>On the day my DeskMini Headless server was born - it was christened with ecryptfs and I did that on purpose - paranoid!
Gearing up for a password-less configuration was supposedly and easy task later then I realised that my first SSH session won&amp;rsquo;t work. This is for obvious reason: the home folder ~/ isn&amp;rsquo;t readable - yet - not until you manually mount the folder. By default SSH will look for authorized_keys file at the user&amp;rsquo;s home folder henced SSH can&amp;rsquo;t read it - you&amp;rsquo;ll get Permission denied (publickey).</description>

      <description>I was trying to copy files to my Raspbian-based Raspberry Pi but I kept getting this error:
 ssh: connect to host 192.168.178.79 port 22: Connection refused
 Tell-tale Sign after few attempts the ssh status showed up an interesting set of logs:
$&amp;gt; sudo service ssh status
‚óè ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled) Active: active (running) since Mon 2017-04-10 08:51:38 UTC; 6min ago Main PID: 1332 (sshd) CGroup: /system.</description>
