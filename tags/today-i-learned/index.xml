      <description>4 days ago, npm published a blog about protecting your account with 2FA. I&amp;rsquo;m a user of Google Authenticator [1], [2] and YubiKey - so it was just perfect timing.
To enable 2FA on your profile, you need to install the beta release of npm client:
$&amp;gt; npm install npm@next -g  and follow the rest of the instruction here: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication</description>

      <description>Today I learned that I can install Ubuntu or Suse Linux, straight from Windows App Store. I might have missed the opportunity which was announced 4 months ago
Notes This is my first post of &amp;ldquo;Today I Learned&amp;rdquo; series of mini-blog: a mixed of tips, resources or anything. I spent at least 8 hours in front of the screen - coding and always learning.</description>
